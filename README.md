ResolutionOnline is a project which aims to render a verified proof system using the Resolution Calculus more available to logicians.

On the figure above an overview of the application is given. ResolutionOnline (accessible here: http://resolution.raspberryip.com/) gives its user the ability to quickly create proofs for a given sentence in first order logic, and to formally verify their proof thanks to Anders Schlittkrull's work in Formalization of the Resolution Calculus for First-Order Logic (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10817-017-9447-z).
